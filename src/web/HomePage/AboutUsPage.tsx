      </Typography>

      <Typography>
        PsychSCREEN is a web-based platform designed to facilitate the interactive visualization and exploration of genetic and epigenetic data on the human brain. The mission of PsychSCREEN is to enhance the understanding of the regulatory elements in the brain that contribute to psychiatric conditions. By integrating a vast array of epigenetic data and utilizing advanced deep learning techniques, PsychSCREEN provides an interactive atlas of candidate brain cis-regulatory elements (b-cCREs). These elements are crucial for understanding how gene regulation occurs in different types of brain cells, including various glia and neurons, and how these processes might be altered by genetic variants such as single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) in psychiatric disorders.

        Key Features
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="h5">
        Interactive visualization:
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1">
      PsychSCREEN offers a user-friendly interface for visualizing genomic annotations from diverse biological perspectives. Users can explore the data through four distinct portals, each providing unique insights into brain cell types and their regulatory elements.
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="h5">
      Disease and Trait Portal:
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1">
      This portal allows users to search for specific psychiatric traits or disorders, such as schizophrenia or neuroticism, and visualize associated risk loci. It integrates GWAS summary statistics and provides interactive genome browser views for detailed exploration of significant SNPs and their annotations.
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="h5">
      Gene Portal:
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1">
      Users can input the name of a gene to explore single-cell expression and differential expression in psychiatric disease (DOI:<a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.adi5199">10.1126/science.adi5199</a>). Furthermore, they can access a comprehensive view of its regulatory annotations, expression patterns, and associated SNPs. This portal includes data from single-cell and bulk ATAC-seq datasets, providing a detailed view of gene regulation in the brain. Users can also navigate an interactive genome browser, displaying single-cell ATAC signal and deep-learned models of base-pair resolution importance to chromatin accessibility around the gene of interest.
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="h5">
      SNP Portal:
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1">
      Allows users to search variants by rsID and view various types of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) from psychENCODE projects (DOI: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.adi5199">10.1126/science.adi5199</a>, DOI: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.adh0829">10.1126/science.adh0829</a>, DOI: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adh2588">10.1126/sciadv.adh2588</a>), summary statistics of genome-wide association studies (GWAS), and intersecting regulatory regions from the ENCODE Registry of cis-regulatory elements (cCREs) and b-cCREs.

      <Typography variant="h5">
      Single Cell Portal: 
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1">
      This portal offers exploration of single-cell datasets, including differential gene expression and chromatin accessibility in various brain cell types. It provides insights into cell type-specific regulatory networks and their implications for brain function and psychiatric disorders. Users can also visualize single-cell ATAC-seq peaks, gene regulatory networks, and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) derived from PsychENCODE data (DOI: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.adi5199">10.1126/science.adi5199</a>).

      Technology and Accessibility
      </Typography>
      <Typography>
      PsychSCREEN was built using modern web technologies, including the ReactJS framework for a seamless user experience and scalable vector graphics (SVG) for high-quality data visualization. The platform's backend is powered by a microservice architecture utilizing Postgres databases and GraphQL APIs, ensuring efficient data retrieval and extensibility. For programmatic access, PsychSCREEN provides a publicly available GraphQL API (<a href="https://psychscreen.api.wenglab.org/graphql">psychscreen.api.wenglab.org/graphql</a>), allowing advanced users to query the datasets directly and integrate them into their research workflows.

      <b>A: PsychSCREEN's disease/SNP portals.</b> A written description of the queried diseaseâ€”Schizophrenia (top right) is displayed with and a view of all risk loci identified by GWAS, and where they appear in the genome (bottom left). Clicking on a locus redirects you to a genome browser (bottom right) spanning the highlighted coordinates, displaying tracks representing b-cCREs, aggregate neuron and glia ATAC signal, Schizophrenia GWAS summary statistics, a set of documented SNPs and their linkage disequilibrium, and base-pair resolution mammalian conservation scores.

      <b>B: PsychSCREEN's gene portal, upon searching for the gene OLIG2.</b> The genome browser is the default view, displaying b-cCREs, aggregate neuron and glia ATAC signal, and ATAC signal on an individual experiment and predicted importance scores from ChromBPNet models of PsychENCODE data. On the ChromBPNet track, highlighting a section of bases (shaded in red) will prompt a search of the closest matching TF motif, and the motif logo is displayed.
